                <p>Manual mode on a camera allows the photographer to determine the exposure of an image by letting them
                    select an aperture value and a shutter speed value. This give you ultimate control over the look of the
                    photo, but you must have a deep understanding of exposure, and how shutter speed and aperture affect it.
                </p>
    
                <p>When most people start out with photography, they let the camera work out the correct exposure in a fully
                    automatic mode. On a DSLR, this mode is often labelled with a P, for “Program”. As knowledge of
                    photography is increased, most people look towards the two semi-automatic exposure modes called aperture
                    priority and shutter priority (AV, TV). These modes give the user control of either aperture or shutter
                    speed, while letting the camera determine the remaining setting for best exposure.</p>
    
                <p>Manual mode takes it one step further and gives you control over both, but why would you want to use it?
                </p>
    
                <p></p>First off, I’d like to bust a myth about shooting in manual. It doesn’t make you a ‘pro’ and not all
                pros shoot in manual. In fact, the vast majority, myself included, do not shoot in manual. 90% of my
                photography is done in either shutter priority or aperture priority. The times when I switch to manual mode
                are simply when I think I can do a better job at judging the scene than my camera can. Typically this is
                when there is a very tough lighting situation, like a strong backlight for example, or rapidly changing
                light due to weather conditions like passing clouds. Camera’s also struggle to correctly meter very bright
                scenes, like a snowy landscape, so this would be another time when I think I can do a better job at choosing
                the exposure.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Shutter_Speed">
                <header class="section-header">Shutter Speed</header>
                <p>The shutter speed tells you the amount of time the camera will be exposed to light. The duration of time
                    is shown in a fraction of seconds, for example it could be ½-second or 1/200 second. A speed of
                    1/200-second is faster than ½-second. Using a faster speed means the image will be darker. If you would
                    like to lighten the image, use a slower shutter speed. However, a faster shutter speed will catch a
                    frame of movement. For example, if you want to capture a still of someone running, you will want a
                    faster shutter speed.</p>

                <header class="section-header">Aperature</header>
                <p>The aperture consists of small blades in the lens that create an adjustable, octagonal shape. It tells
                    you how big the hole is in your lens. The smaller the hole is, the less light passes through it. The
                    wider the hole is, the more light will enter your lens. It’s best to think of the aperture as a pupil
                    that can be controlled by you. The aperture is measured by your f-stop. The higher the f-stop (f22), the
                    smaller the hole and the darker your image will be.</p>
    
                <p>The f-stop also measures the depth of field. A lower f-stop (f2.8) will give you more depth to your
                    image. For example, if you are taking a photo of a person and would like the background to be a bit
                    blurry, you would choose a low f-stop. If you are taking a picture of beautiful scenery, you would want
                    a higher f-stop to make sure everything is in focus.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="ISO">
                <header class="section-header">ISO</header>
                <p>The ISO is a control within the camera that will affect the exposure. A high ISO will yield a brighter
                    image, but it could also create a grainier, or noisy, image. For example, setting your camera to ISO
                    1600 will lighten the image and make it noisier. If you are using ISO 400, the images will be sharper
                    and darker. If you are using an analog SLR, consider matching the ISO on your camera to the ISO of your
                    film. It will help when you are light metering your image.</p>
    
                <p>On SLR cameras, there are creative modes that give you slight control over a few of the settings. The two
                    common ones that photographers use are shutter priority and aperture priority. Shutter priority means
                    you have control over the shutter speed and ISO whereas aperture priority gives you control over
                    aperture and ISO. The camera will adjust the aperture and shutter speed, respectively, for the best
                    exposure.</p>
    
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Light_Meter">
                <header class="section-header">Light Meter</header>
                <p>The light meter is a tool used to gauge your manual settings. If the light meter reads “0”, it means that
                    there is enough light to capture your image. It also indicates that your image should be well-balanced.
                    If your light meter reads negative, it means the image will be underexposed, or too dark. A light meter
                    that reads positive will mean the image will be overexposed, or too light. You can adjust the different
                    settings on your camera to pull the meter to zero.</p>
    
                <p> you are ready to shoot in manual mode, here is one way to go through your settings. Choose the ISO that
                    would best work for your lighting conditions. If you are in a darker space or indoors, choose a higher
                    ISO. Second, decide if depth of field or motion is more important. If you choose depth of field, you
                    will need to adjust your aperture before you compensate with the appropriate shutter speed; vice versa
                    for motion. Make slight adjustments based on the results.</p>
    
                <p>There are a couple of tricks to use when trying to find the right balance for an image. For a medium
                    level of ISO sensitivity, the shutter speed and aperture can be in the middle also. However, if you use
                    a high ISO sensitivity, a faster shutter speed means you should make your aperture larger (low f-stop)
                    and a slow shutter speed means you should make your aperture smaller (high f-stop).</p>
